Goal: Make useDropArea solely responsible for handling drops directly onto the area itself (especially when empty or receiving blocks from other areas) and providing basic drag state feedback for that area. Delegate complex indicator logic and internal reordering to components.

Refactoring Steps:

    Focus drop Handler:

        Modify the drop handler to only execute addBlock or moveBlock logic if:

            The dropArea is currently empty (dropArea.blocks.length === 0).

            OR the dragged item is an EXISTING_BLOCK coming from a different sourceDropAreaId.

        In all other cases (e.g., populated area, internal reordering), the drop handler should immediately return undefined to allow nested drop targets (like in DropAreaContent) to handle the event.

        Ensure the monitor.didDrop() check and markDropHandled logic remain to prevent duplicate processing.

    Simplify hover Handler:

        Remove mouse position tracking (mousePosition state) and edge proximity detection logic (isNearEdge, mergeTarget state).

        The hover handler should primarily focus on monitor.isOver({ shallow: true }) to set the isHovering state used for direct visual feedback on the area itself (e.g., background highlight).

    Delegate Indicator Logic:

        Remove shouldShowSplitIndicator and shouldShowMergeIndicator logic and related state (mergePosition) from the hook.

        Merge Indicators: Responsibility shifts entirely to parent layout components (DesktopDropArea, TabletDropArea, MobileDropArea) which manage the gaps between areas.

        Split Indicator (Center Button): The DropArea component can decide to show this button based on props (showSplitIndicator) and state derived from the hook (isHovering, !isOver) combined with store checks (canSplit, area.blocks.length === 0).

    Streamline State & Return Value:

        Remove internal state related to mouse position and merging (mousePosition, mergeTarget, mergePosition).

        Simplify getDropAreaStyles to only depend on isOver, canDrop, dropError, and potentially an isEmpty flag (derived from dropArea.blocks.length). Merge/split highlighting should be handled by components.

        The hook should primarily return isOver, canDrop, the drop ref connector, and potentially isHovering (if needed by the component for the split button).

    Update Consuming Components:

        Refactor DropArea, DesktopDropArea, TabletDropArea, and MobileDropArea to handle the display logic for split/merge indicators based on their layout context and the simplified state from the refactored hook.

        Ensure DropAreaContent correctly handles all drops within populated areas.

Outcome: A leaner useDropArea hook focused on its core drop target responsibilities, with clearer separation of concerns, making the overall D&D system easier to understand and maintain. Complex layout-dependent interactions (like merging) are managed at the appropriate component level.
